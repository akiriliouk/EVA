```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r prelim}
library(mev)
load("Wind.RData")
```

Sample size and number of variables:

```{r}
dim(Wind)
```

Fitting a univariate GEV distribution to the first station:

```{r}
fit.gev(Wind[,1], show=TRUE)
```

```{r}
chi <- taildep(data = Wind, depmeas = "chi", u = 0.9)
chi
```

Transform observations component-wise to ranks, transform to unit-FrÃ©chet margins, and estimate 

```{r}
WindRanks <- apply(Wind, MARGIN = 2, FUN = rank)
dim(WindRanks)
```
